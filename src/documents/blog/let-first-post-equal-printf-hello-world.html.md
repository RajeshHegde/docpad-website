Of all the [Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program "Hello World!")'s that I've written, this one seems closest to the truth. One of the goals I have for this blog is to communicate with the world; to share my experiences and thoughts in the hope that someone else can benefit from them. 

What experiences exactly? I'm a developer to the bone. I love to create through code; and I spend my working hours, and as many as I can outside of work, creating. So you can bet that most of what you'll see on here is developer related.

If you have an interest in [F#](http://www.tryfsharp.org/ "Try F#"), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language "C#"), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") or the [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/ "Xamarin") products, make sure you subscribe by pressing the feed icon that will be somewhere on the screen. (Darn responsive layouts, you never know where anything is!)

Of course, I may have missed the plot entirely; the [console](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") is the world, and you say hello by writing text to it.

``` fsharp
let firstPost = printf "Hello, world!";;

Hello, world!
val firstPost : unit = ()
```
It's probably best not to take any chances.
