Of all the [Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program "Hello World!")'s that I've written, this one seems closest to the truth; I'm actually saying hello to the world.

I'm a developer to the bone. I love to create through code; I spend hours creating, both at work and home. So you can bet that most of what you'll see on here is developer related.

 I'll use this blog to share my experiences and thoughts as a developer, in the hope that someone else can benefit from them. Iâ€™d love to learn from you, too. Feel free to contact me with a [comment](#comments "Comments"), on [Twitter](<%= @site.twitterUrl %> "Twitter"), or by [email](<%= @site.emailUrl%> "hello@troykershaw.com").

If you have an interest in [F#](http://www.tryfsharp.org/ "Try F#"), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language "C#"), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") or the [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/ "Xamarin") products, make sure you subscribe by pressing the feed icon that will be somewhere on the screen. (Darn responsive layouts, you never know where anything is!)

Of course, I may have missed the plot entirely; the [console](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") is the world, and you say hello by writing text to it.

``` fsharp
let firstPost = printf "Hello, world!";;

Hello, world!
val firstPost : unit = ()
```

It's probably best not to take any chances.
